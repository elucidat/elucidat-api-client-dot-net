==================================

An example .NET client for the [Elucidat E-learning Authoring tool](https://www.elucidat.com) API.


Prerequisites
-------------

This solution requires Visual Studio 2013 and .NET framework 4 or higher.

Configuring and running the example
-----------------------------------

You will need to set your public and private API keys, and the email address
associated with your account, in the <appSettings> section of App.config before 
building the solution.

Once built, you can run the example program by opening a command prompt in the
ExampleClient\bin\Debug folder, and running ExampleClient.exe. Note that if 
your Elucidat account does not yet contain any projects, or your projects do not
yet have releases, some of the test methods may fail.
